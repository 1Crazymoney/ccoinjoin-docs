# Funding History

To date, the Collaborative CoinJoin project has undergone a single funding round. This allowed the initial project to be created and a working prototype to be developed. This created the initial code repositories and framework that will allow future collaboration between wallet developers.

Future Flipstarter campaigns are planned to fund additional development. Now that the code repositories and initial framework has been established, work on the project can be delegated to lower-cost software developers, and the project overall can get more 'bang for the buck' from future funding campaigns.
